# Variational Inference: A Review for Programmers

This sequence of notebooks are intended as a resource aimed at programmers to learn the concepts behind variational methods and their implementation. Our presentation will usually outline some concept and will complement it with an illustrative example. As I have been learning the ideas behind VI, I found that the code resources for it are scarce and obscure, so it was born out of my own experience learning this.


## TODOs
- Upload first foundations notebook.
  - Add Forward KL in examples.
  - Add mixture of Gaussians example.
- The ELBO and Mean-field variational inference.
- VAE.
- Black-box and ADVI VI.
- Amortized VI.
- Forward Amortized VI.
- Wake-sleep algorithm.
- Add references.
